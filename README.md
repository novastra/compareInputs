# compareInputs
A Q&D Javascript file that compares all inputs in a page, check their values and return all the changed ones in an array.
The fields to be compared have a key based on ids, but the script can be changed to use a special attribute for this.

###Demo <a target="_blank" href="http://novastra.net/demo/compareInputs/">available here</a> 

####The code has still to be improved :
<ul>
<li>Create inputs query function as a helper function used in both cases (former and new)</li>
<li>Create an alternate method for the querySelectorAll that is not supported on IE <= IE7 </li>
</ul>
