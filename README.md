# compareInputs
Javascript that compares all inputs in a page, check their values and return all the changed ones in array.

####The code has still to be improved :
<ul>
<li>Create input query function as a handler function used in both cases (initial and new)</li>
<li>Make sure this function gets both ids, names, class, etc, (concatenate) as primary key (id in arrays) to have all inputs</li>
</ul>
