# compareInputs
A Q&D Javascript file that compares all inputs in a page, check their values and return all the changed ones in an array.

The fields to be compared have a key based on ids, but the script can be changed to use a special attribute for this.

####The code has still to be improved but if it can be of an use I'm glad.
<ul>
<li>Create inputs query function as a helper function used in both cases (former and new)</li>

</ul>
